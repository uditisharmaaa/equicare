## üí° Inspiration

Healthcare disparities affect millions, with studies showing that implicit bias leads to delayed diagnoses, inadequate pain management, and substandard care for marginalized communities. Women are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed during heart attacks, and Black patients receive 40% less pain medication than white patients for identical conditions. We were inspired to create a solution that could objectively identify and address these biases in real-time, making healthcare more equitable for everyone.

## üöÄ What it does

EquiCare is an AI-powered healthcare equity platform that transforms doctor-patient interactions into actionable insights. The system features:

- **Real-time transcription** of medical conversations using advanced speech recognition
- **AI-powered bias detection** across multiple dimensions: communication quality, clinical thoroughness, and patient validation
- **Hospital admin dashboard** providing comprehensive analytics on doctor performance, patient demographics, and bias trends
- **Patient empowerment tools** allowing individuals to rate their experiences and maintain their medical interaction history
- **Multi-dimensional scoring system** (0-10 scale) that distinguishes between appropriate clinical skepticism and harmful bias

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

We built EquiCare using a modern, scalable tech stack:

- **Frontend:** React with Vite for fast development, Tailwind CSS for responsive design, and React Router for seamless navigation
- **Backend:** Supabase for real-time database management
- **AI Integration:** Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet API with custom prompt engineering for nuanced bias detection
- **Speech Processing:** Chrome Speech to Text for real-time transcription with multi-language support
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts for interactive analytics dashboards
- **Deployment:** Optimized for cloud deployment with environment-based configuration

## üë• Individual Contributions

We split the project into its different core functionalities:
- User page development
- Admin page development
- Home page development
- Frontend design
- Backend setup and database management

## üöß Challenges we ran into

- **Bias Detection Accuracy:** Balancing sensitivity to detect subtle bias while avoiding false positives from appropriate medical skepticism
- **Real-time Processing:** Optimizing speech recognition and AI analysis to work seamlessly in real-time medical environments
- **API Rate Limiting:** Managing Anthropic API calls efficiently while processing multiple conversations
